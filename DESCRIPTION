Title: Adaptive Variant Filtering using generalized boosted regression models
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Yuanhang Liu <liu.yuanhang@mayo.edu>
Maintainer: Yuanhang Liu <liu.yuanhang@mayo.edu>
Description: We developed a bioinformatics tool kit consisting of two major modules: first annotation component to annotate various genomics features given SV calls and overlaps with polymorphism CNVs; the second module used boosted regression to construct a predictive model of SV filtering/prioritization based on these features.
